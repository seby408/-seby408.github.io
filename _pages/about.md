title: "About Me"
---
With my experience in consulting in the Salesforce space, I've been able to drive revenue success through continuous process improvement, systems refinement, and actionable insights to increase revenue, sales productivity, and operational efficiency. I've obtained 10 Salesforce certifications and 1 Tableau certification.

In addition to my work, I am also the Co-founder of Fuerza Ventures, a firm focused on strengthening underrepresented founders.

I was born in San Jose, but I grew up in the Sacramento area. In 2021, I moved to Dallas, TX. I'm a first-generation Mexican-American and the very first of my family to attend a four-year institution, UC Davis.

In my spare time, I enjoy soccer (Arsenal FC), tennis, and traveling to learn about different cultures. I've visited over 30 different countries.
