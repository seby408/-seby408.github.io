I've obtained 9 Salesforce certifications and 1 Tableau certification.

In addition to Blockdaemon, I am also the Co-founder of Fuerza Ventures, a firm focused on stregthening underrepresented founders.

I was born in San Jose, but I grew up in the Sacramento area. In 2021, I moved to Dallas,TX in 2021. I'm a first-generation Mexican-American and the very first of my family to attend a four-year institution, UC Davis.
